## Features
This smart contract allows landlords to create rental offers and securely manage deposits, while tenants can pay deposits and book rentals safely. It tracks the rental status (`Available`, `Rented`, `Completed`) and ensures that deposits are returned correctly after the rental period, using safe ETH transfers and time-based management.
